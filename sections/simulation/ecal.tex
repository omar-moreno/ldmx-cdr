\subsection{Simulation of the Calorimetry Systems (Editors: Owen Colegrove, Joe Incandela)}

A common simulation framework is utilized for the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeter systems based solely on {\tt GEANT4}.
In addition to a full implementation of the sampling layers for both calorimeters, the target, recoil tracker and magnetic field are also included.
