Basic Considerations and Overview
\begin{itemize}
    \item Signal characteristics
    \item Possible backgrounds 
    \item Achieving high luminosity 
    \item Explain why we want a tagger tracker, moderate 0.1 X0 target, recoil 
          tracker, high granularity calorimeter, hadronic veto
    \item Summarize the overall layout of the experiment 
\end{itemize}
