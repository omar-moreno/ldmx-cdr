\subsection{Signal Characteristics}

Please note that we need to optimize the energy selection used below. Starting
definition: 

\textbf{Tracking:} 
\begin{itemize}
    \item One incoming beam electron with $E_{beam}$ close to $4$ GeV and a well
          measured trajectory. 
    \item Quality cuts (as needed) to reduce any dangerous brem 
          (or photo-nuclear) reactions in the tagger tracker material
    \item One recoiling electron with $E\lesssim 1.2$ GeV that points back to 
          the incoming beam electron track. 
    \item An activity cut in the recoil tracker to reject photo-nuclear 
          reactions in the target
    \item An inferred ``missing momentum'' trajectory and magnitude 
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Calorimetry:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item One soft recoil shower with $E\lesssim 1.2$ GeV that is consistent 
          with recoil tracker trajectory
    \item An activity cut in the ``missing momentum'' region for the ECal
    \item An explicit veto on energetic (energy range needs to be specified)
          hadrons in both the ECal and hadron veto system 
\end{itemize}
